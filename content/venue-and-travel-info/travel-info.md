Prague is easily accessible by plane (via the VÃ¡clav Havel Airport) or by train (the main railway station is only several stops away from the venue by public transport). Uber and other affordable taxi networks such as Bolt operate in Prague and can be recommended rather than picking taxis in the streets.
